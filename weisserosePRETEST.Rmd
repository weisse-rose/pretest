This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
getwd()
```


```{r}
```

```{r}
edges <- read.csv("weisserose_edgelist.csv")
edges
head(edges)
```

```{r}
nodes <- read.csv("weisserose_nodelist.csv")
nodes
head(nodes)
```

```{r}
ties <-  as.matrix(edges)
knots <- as.matrix(nodes)
weisserose <-  graph_from_data_frame(d=ties,vertices=knots, directed=F)
plot(weisserose)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
